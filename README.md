# Hangman-Game-Python

Simple Hangman Game

I developed this project during my participation in the MITx: 6.00.1x "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" course. The game operates with a word text file, and it's important to note that the file should be in the same folder for proper functionality.
Game Features and Modifications:

1.	When a player inputs characters outside the alphabet, a notification informs them that the entered letter is invalid. However, the number of guesses remains unchanged, ensuring a consistent challenge.
2.	After completing 8 guesses without successfully identifying the word, a message is displayed along with the revelation of the secret word. This modification adds a sense of closure to the game.
3.	The game follows the basic Hangman implementation: players have 8 chances to guess the word. Correct guesses do not impact the remaining chances, while incorrect guesses decrease the chances by one.


I hope you enjoy playing this Hangman game! Feel free to provide comments or suggest modificationsâ€”your feedback is highly appreciated.
